        <p>
          Gabriel Tunggala is a student in Georgia Tech's Coding Boot Camp. She
          continues to try logging in 25 hours of coding and studying for the
          course, but from time to time, enjoys pretending to be a sophisticated
          film buff and admits to spending too much time perfecting her playlists.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          When Gabriel is not talking about her two cats, cuddling her baby
          nephew, or acknowledging how predictable her life often is, she is an
          advocate for living a life well spent.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          Gabriel believes that the power of storytelling, along with creativity
          and technology are proponents of bettering humanity. She's passionate
          about work that seeks to provide sustainable solutions versus the
          one-time aid commonly provided- whether it be in education, poverty, or
          the workforce. Providing everyone access to clean water, abolishing
          human trafficking, and building healthy communities are just a few ideas
          that excite her. Her belief to see the world, not as it is, but as it
          could be has fortified the work ethics she brings and her eagerness to
          grow.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          She’s extremely introverted, but likes to make new friends, so don’t be
          afraid to say hello. If you'd really like to know her, mention that you
          like drinking matcha and ask why "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" is
          her favorite film.
